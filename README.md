# dChess
Multiplayer chess using socket.io

While the game is fully functional,there is no explicit messaging used.
So while you can't move any pieces after checkmate, its upto you to know that its checkmate >_<
Currently playable between two players. The first one is automatically assigned whte while the second player to join would be black.

I will hopefully handle that along with a lobby system for managing multiple games in future (<i>whatever</i> that might be)
